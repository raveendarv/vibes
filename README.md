# Twitter Sentiment Analyser
## VIBES‚Äù 
It is a Machine Learning Project that is used to analyze the tweets based on the user input as well as provide a text summarization for the text entered.
We have worked with React JS for front-end, Python-Flask framework for back-end, SQLite for the Database and we have also used an API from www.twitter.com which provides us with the tweets necessary for performing the sentimental analysis of a given keyword.
